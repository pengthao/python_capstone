# Intro
    My name is Peng. I am currently a data analyst looking to enter into 
    software devlopment field. I have been having a lot of fun in the python
    progam and I look forward to continuing to grow and learn in this space.

## Elevator Pitch
    My capstone project aims to centralize job searches by scraping the postings from multiple 
    sites and aggregating them into one location where you can select your favorite listings 
    and track the status of that job.
